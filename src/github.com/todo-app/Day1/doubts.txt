clarification on master branch

Suppose there are more than few people are working on same project and this project is used in production and testing server. 

To make it smooth and avoid confussion, we create multiple branches, first branch is master which is created when you create repo. 

Different people follow different convention but idea is same to make sanity between different stages of development cycle. 

Like dev branch where developers will push there changes 
testing branch where people will pull from dev once they are ready for testing 
production when they confidence that now theses changes can move to client,
