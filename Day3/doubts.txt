1.upgrading dependencies,why this is done ,how?(last day doubt left)

// suppose you are using libs, to use lib you need to get it there are many way to do it, golang is using module as official support. 



2.func main() {
	a := 'hey
	    "hi" hooi'
	fmt.Println(a)
}
this is giving error.cant we write string like this?

to save multiline string you have to use "`" your code should look like 

a := `hey
	    "hi" hooi`
	    
you used "'" you have to use "`" 

3.what is flagthrough ?why it is used?

// please explain your question
